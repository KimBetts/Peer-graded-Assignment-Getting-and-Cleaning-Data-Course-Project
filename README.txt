The R code file - run_analysis - does the following

1. Downloads and unzips the files

2. Merges (or rather appends) the testing and training sets, inclusing the outcome and subject ID (which were stored in separate files)

3. Extracts only the mean and SD of predictor variables

4. Reformats and renames variables to be user friendly

5. Summarises the predictors by subject ID and activity

6. Saves the new file as a CSV
